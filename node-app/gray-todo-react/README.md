# TODO-List based on Node.js and React

Builing a ToDo list application with node and React, for catching up with the basics of react again.
Well to set up the requirements for this application, let us take a user story into consideration. As a user I can,

- read a list of tasks.
- add a task using the mouse or keyboard.
- mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard.
- delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
- edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard.
- view a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only the completed tasks.

## Work to be done

- Create a basic frontend on React which gives us a UI for all the above requirements.
- Add a DB to store this user data.
- Add a auth for making it accessible by different users.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
